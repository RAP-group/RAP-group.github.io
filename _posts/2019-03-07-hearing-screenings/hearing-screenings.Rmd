The RU Speech and Hearing Club hosted a free Hearing Screening in the 
RAP-group sound booth on 1 Spring street. 

The purpose of the event was to allow aspiring audiologists and speech 
pathologists in the Speech and Hearing Club hands-on experience 
administering hearing tests using audiometers with professional 
audiologist, Dr. Karen Kushla.

The Speech and Hearing Club members worked in pairs, with one student 
operating the audiometer while the other student noted the results. 
Dr. Kushla supervised the screening and interpreted the results for the 
participants.

In a typical hearing screening a series of tones are presented through 
headphones one ear at a time and the hearer raises their hand if/when they 
hear the tone. First, a 500 Hz pure tone at 40 dB HL. If the hearer perceives 
the tone then the intensity is reduced to 25 dB HL, and then to 20 dB HL. 
Next, the frequency is raised to 1000 Hz and the process is repeated. 

It was a great experience for some future audiologists.
