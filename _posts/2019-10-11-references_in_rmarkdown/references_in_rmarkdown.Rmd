Using RMarkdown to generate reproducible documents has a lot of advantages. 
One of them is the ability to import `.bib` files to cite sources and 
automagically generate a bibliography. 
In this post we will go over a simple workflow for importing a bib file, 
citing some articles, and generating a references section in APA format. 
Specifically, we will cover two ways to do this. 
The first method is more general and probably works best if your desired 
output is HTML. 
The second method relies on the `papaja` package.<sup>1</sup> 
It is probably a bit easier and ideal when your desired output is PDF or word.
